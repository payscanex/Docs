  Ethereum networks.

# Multi ERC-20: Ethereum â†” payscan Network Coin

## Architecture Overview

This bridge is two layer bridge. In the base level the  Arbitrary Message Bridge \(AMB\) is responsible for relaying messages between the networks. On top of the AMB,  the pluggable mediators implement a contract logic of token relaying of various assets.

## How to use

Any payscan Network20 token can be bridged for Ethereum to the payscan Network Coin. If the token is relayed for the first time. A bridged token, paired with the original token, will be created on the payscan Network Coin network. 

To send token from the Ethereum network:

1. Approve the payscan Network20 tokens to be spent by the Foreign payscan Network20 bridge. 
2. Call relayTokens function on the bridge contract

the `relayTokens` method will lock the payscan Network20 tokens on the foreign bridge. After a couple of confirmations, an equal amount of the payscan Network Coin payscan Network20 token will be sent from the home bridge contract.

To send tokens from payscan Network Coin network

1. Approve the payscan Network20 tokens to be spent by the Home payscan Network20 bridge. 
2. Call `relayTokens` function on the bridge contract

the `relayTokens` method will lock the bridged tokens on the home bridge. Then, an equal amount of the paired payscan Network20 token will be sent from the foreign bridge contract.
